# Using JOML for Transformations in Ray Tracing

This project utilizes the **Java OpenGL Math Library (JOML)** for handling matrix transformations applied to the camera and objects (spheres) in a ray tracing engine.

## Why JOML?
JOML provides an efficient and easy-to-use API for working with **3D transformations**, including translation, scaling, and rotation. It simplifies applying transformations to objects in the scene and adjusting the cameraâ€™s position and orientation.

## Transformations in This Project

### 1. **Camera Transformation**
   - The camera is represented using a **position vector** and an **orientation matrix (Matrix3d)**.
   - The orientation matrix is initialized as an identity matrix but can be modified for rotations.

### 2. **Object (Sphere) Transformations**
   - Each sphere can have a **global transformation matrix (Matrix4d)** applied.
   - This allows for scaling, translation, and rotation of individual spheres.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Matrix4d globalTransform = new Matrix4d()
         .translate(0, 1, 3)
         .scale(0.8);
     ```
   - The transformation is applied when computing intersections and normal vectors.

## How It Works
1. **Spheres are defined in world space** with transformations applied.
2. **Ray intersections are computed considering transformations** to ensure proper object placement.
3. **Lighting and shading calculations** take into account the transformed positions and normals.

## Running the Project
1. Ensure you have JOML in your classpath.
2. Compile and run the Java program.
3. The generated image will show transformed spheres with correct shading and lighting effects.
