# Ray Tracer in Java
This repository contains a simple ray tracer implementation in Java, capable of rendering spheres in 3D space onto a 2D canvas. The result is saved as a PNG image file.


# Features
Basic ray tracing to compute intersections between rays and spheres.
Adjustable canvas size and viewport dimensions.
Ability to render multiple spheres with different colors.

## Instructions to Run the Code
Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

### Compile the Code: Use javac to compile all .java files:
bash
javac *.java
### Run the Code: Run the raytracing class using java:
bash
java raytracing
## Output: The rendered image will be saved in the current directory as output.png.
