# Ray Tracer in Java
This repository contains a simple ray tracer implementation in Java, capable of rendering spheres in 3D space onto a 2D canvas. The result is saved as a PNG image file.


# Features
Basic ray tracing to compute intersections between rays and spheres.
Adjustable canvas size and viewport dimensions.
Ability to render multiple spheres with different colors.
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
Basic knowledge of running Java programs.
